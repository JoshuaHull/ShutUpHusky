# ShutUpHusky (not really, you're alright)

I like Husky, but I don't like conventional commits until I'm merging to Main.

ShutUpHusky automates your commit messages. Doesn't do it well, but doesn't fail either.

This project should probably be called "ShutUpConventionalCommits", but "ShutUpHusky" is much more catchy.

## Usage

Stage your changes as you normally would, then:
